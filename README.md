# Harappa World Distance Calculator

A complete tool for calculating Euclidean genetic distances between a user's HarappaWorld profile and 1,985 individual HarappaWorld samples collected across South and Central Asia.

This project includes:

- A Python backend (with virtual environment support)
- An interactive frontend (HTML/JS)
- A dataset containing nearly two thousand HarappaWorld individual samples
- Optional filtering (e.g., by population labels such as "Punjabi")

The tool lets you input your HarappaWorld percentages and returns the closest matching individuals from the dataset.
